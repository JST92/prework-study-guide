# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description 

This is the required prework for the Front End Developer Bootcamp course. This was built to allow me to learn some of the basic skills that we will be using throughout our course and hopefully into a future career. By building this webpage, I was able to put into practice what I was learning. This covered things such as using Git, using the CLI, being introduced to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
